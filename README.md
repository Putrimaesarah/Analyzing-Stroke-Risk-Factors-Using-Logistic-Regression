# Analyzing-Stroke-Risk-Factors-Using-Logistic-Regression
This study aims to identify key risk factors associated with stroke using a logistic regression model. The analysis includes demographic, medical, and lifestyle-related variables, with the target variable being stroke status (0 = no, 1 = yes). After data cleaning and multicollinearity checks, the results indicate that age, hypertension, heart disease, and average glucose level significantly increase the likelihood of stroke. The model demonstrates strong performance, with an AUC of 0.844 and a Hosmer-Lemeshow test confirming good model fit. These findings offer valuable insights for stroke prevention by highlighting the importance of managing major risk factors.
